    "The choice of a regression metric for evaluating an SVM regression model in this dataset depends on the specific goals and characteristics of your prediction task. Here are a few regression metrics you can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
    "   - MAE is the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual house prices. It gives you a measure of the average magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
    "   - MSE is similar to MAE but squares the differences before averaging. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**\n",
    "   - RMSE is the square root of MSE. It is in the same unit as the target variable (house price), making it more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **R-squared (R2):**\n",
    "   - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the house prices that is explained by the SVM regression model. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mean Percentage Error (MPE) or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):**\n",
    "   - These metrics express errors as a percentage of the actual house prices, providing a relative measure of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between these metrics depends on your specific objectives. If you want to minimize the impact of large errors, RMSE or MAPE might be suitable. If you prefer a metric that is easier to interpret, MAE or R-squared might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before selecting a metric, split your dataset into training and testing sets, train the SVM regression model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the testing set using various metrics. This helps you understand how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data."

    "If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, you would likely prefer a metric that directly measures the accuracy of your predictions. In this case, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be more appropriate than R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
    "   - MSE directly measures the average squared difference between your predicted values and the actual values. It gives higher weight to larger errors, making it sensitive to deviations from the true prices. Lower MSE values indicate better predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R-squared (R2):**\n",
    "   - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable (house prices) that is explained by your model. While R-squared is a valuable metric for assessing the overall goodness of fit, it may not be as intuitive for directly assessing prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MSE is a more direct measure of accuracy and aligns with your goal of predicting house prices as accurately as possible. However, it's always a good practice to consider multiple metrics and understand their implications in the context of our specific use case. we might also want to consider other metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to get a comprehensive view of your model's performance."

    "In a scenario where your dataset has a significant number of outliers, it's often advisable to choose regression metrics that are less sensitive to extreme values. Two such metrics are particularly suitable in the presence of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
    "   - MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to Mean Squared Error (MSE) because it uses the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. This means that large errors (caused by outliers) don't get disproportionately magnified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Huber Loss:**\n",
    "   - Huber Loss is a hybrid loss function that combines the best of MSE and MAE. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE but provides some error magnification to prevent outliers from having too much influence. The Huber Loss uses a tuning parameter (delta) to determine the point at which it transitions from an L1 (MAE-like) loss to an L2 (MSE-like) loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing one of these metrics can be beneficial when dealing with datasets containing outliers, as they provide a more robust evaluation of model performance. SVM models can also be sensitive to outliers, and selecting an appropriate metric helps in assessing the model's ability to make accurate predictions despite the presence of extreme values."

However, it's essential to understand the characteristics of both metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error):**\n",
    "   - MSE measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It is sensitive to the scale of the data because it involves squaring the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**\n",
    "   - RMSE is the square root of MSE and is in the same unit as the target variable. It is useful for providing an interpretable measure of the average magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you mentioned that both MSE and RMSE are very close, you may consider using RMSE, especially if interpretability in the original units of the target variable is important. However, keep in mind that RMSE tends to penalize larger errors more than smaller errors due to the squaring operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if the difference between MSE and RMSE is minimal and interpretability in the original units is crucial, we can choose RMSE. Alternatively, we might also consider reporting both metrics to provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance."

    "- **R-squared (R2):**\n",
    "  - R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variance, and 1 indicates perfect explanation. It represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is captured by the model. A higher R-squared value suggests a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing different models with different kernels, look for the model that yields the highest R-squared value, as it indicates the model's effectiveness in explaining the variance in the target variable.\n",

    "Keep in mind that while R-squared is a useful metric for assessing the goodness of fit, it may have limitations, especially when dealing with overfitting or complex models.
